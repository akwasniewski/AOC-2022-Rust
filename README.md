# Advent of Code 2022 Solutions in Rust

This repository contains my solutions to the [Advent of Code 2022](https://adventofcode.com/2022) puzzles written in Rust.

I'm learning Rust while solving these problems, so please keep that in mind when reviewing my code.

## Requirements

- Rust (stable)

## Usage

To run a specific day's solution, navigate to the corresponding directory and run:

```sh
rustc day*.rs
./day*
```

(Replace \* sign by day number and problem part A/B)

eg. For the first part of problem 5 run:

```sh
rustc day5A.rs
./day5A
```
